            Rope Hammock - Chances are when you first read the word “hammock” at
            the start of this article an image popped into your head. It was
            likely the rope net, lashed between two trees, waiting for someone
            to climb in and take a little nap. That would be the rope hammock.
            Typically, rope hammocks are made of either cotton or polyester
            ropes, and in order to keep the user from flipping too much, it
            includes a spreader bar at either end to help it keep its flat
            shape, rather than bunching up. Trust me, you don’t want a rope
            hammock without a spreader bar.</a

        <div class="box2" id="#campinghammock">
          Camping Hammock - My personal favorite, at least in concept, is the
          quilted hammock. The quilted hammock is composed of two fabric layers
          stuffed with some sort of soft filling. Since it’s all cloth, these
          aren’t the best hammocks to use outdoors but are very comfortable. In
          fact, this might make for a good bedroom hammock, if that’s something
          you’re interested in. If you really want to go all in, a quilted
          hammock might even be your best bet for an indoor hammock bed.
        </div>
        <div class="box2" id="#quiltedhammock">
          Quilted Hammock - Quilted hammocks are exactly what they sounds like:
          hammocks with a solid, fabric bottom that's sewn together in the style
          of a quilt. That is, there are sections sewn together with tufted,
          plush filling to keep you comfy.
        </div>
        <div class="box2" id="#poolsidehammock">
          Poolside Hammock - If hopping onto a hammock after climbing out of the
          pool is in the cards for you, you should greatly consider getting a
          poolside hammock. Though it doesn’t have to be placed beside a pool,
          it is recommended. The fabric used to create the hammock is made to
          allow water to quickly move through it, not allowing it to build up
          and either keep you wet or encourage the growth of mildew. Plus, it’s
          a great way to add some visual interest to your backyard pool area,
          much like adding a nice decorative rug to an interior space.

        <div class="box2" id="#hammockwithstand">
          Hammock with Stand - As we know there are many kinds of hammocks
          available on the market, such as camping hammocks, hanging chairs and
          porch swings. If you have a traditional hammock it is sure you have to
          find two trees or posts in order to use it. They need external
          support. This is a real challenge to find two trees in the nature
          which are close enough to each other to set up your hammock. It is
          also true for your backyard but if you choose a hammock with stand you
          do not need to wonder about the distance between trees again.

          Sitting Hammock - “Where do I start, as I float in this cloud of
          comfort relaxing, listening to the sounds of nature around me?” asks
          one reviewer, one of many who find themselves melting into the comfort
          of this hammock chair. “I spend a little bit of time in it most
          evenings; it is a comfortable and relaxing spot to sit and enjoy the
          garden after a day at work,” one writes, and plenty of others are also
          pleased with the quality, despite the low price. “The hardware is
          sturdy enough to withstand the kids actually swinging on it,” but it
          holds up adults, too. One explains, “I am near the top end of weight
          limit on the swing, and there have been no issues.” This is also
          suitable for either indoor or outdoor use, which is especially nice
          when you can’t leave the house. “It gave us the opportunity of being
          on vacation on our own apartment,” one reviewer says. However, if you
          are using it outdoors, one reviewer suggests that “you keep it hung on
          a carabiner for easy takedown for when it rains. I bring mine in every
          time though, just to make sure it will last as long as possible.”

        <div class="box2" id="#portablehammock">
          Portable Hammock - A quintessential prop strung between two bending
          palms in pirate movies since the earliest days of cinema, hammocks
          surely don’t have a role in modern travel do they? Actually, they do,
          with modern portable versions of the Caribbean invention rapidly
          becoming a popular alternative for tents, chairs, and beach blankets.
          What’s with this change of heart from campers and lovers of the great
          outdoors? For one thing, the best portable hammocks do not suffer the
          main problem with tents – lumpy, uneven, and sloping ground, giving
          users a better night’s sleep. But portable hammocks are also
          lightweight and can be used wherever you can find a couple of trees or
          other supports – which is nearly everywhere!

          <a id="#treehammock">
            Tree Hammock - To easily hang and remove a portable hammock outdoors
            for camping or in a yard, use tree straps or two lengths of rope for
            each end of the hammock. Choose two sturdy trees about 14 to 16-feet
            apart. Tie on the tree straps according to the instructions and
            attach the hammock's ends to the tree straps.</a

          <a id="pillows">
            Pillows - A support of the body at rest for comfort, therapy, or
            decoration. Pillows are used by many species, including humans. Some
            types of pillows include throw pillows, body pillows, decorative
            pillows and many more. Pillows that aid sleeping are a form of
            bedding that supports the head and neck. Other types of pillows are
            designed to support the body when lying down or sitting. There are
            also pillows that consider human body shape for increased comfort
            during sleep. Decorative pillows used on people, couches or chairs
            are sometimes referred to as cushions.</a
